A motivated junior software developer, I'm really interested in OOP, TDD/BDD, the SOLID principles, and keeping my code DRY. I've recently completed an intensive sixteen week software development bootcamp (four weeks part time and twelve weeks full time) at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/), during which I learned to code following best practices and agile methodologies.

I'm currently looking for my first employment opportunity as a junior software developer, preferably in a position where I can provide immediate value whilst ensuring that personal growth remains a priority.

I began blogging throughout my Makers Academy experience, which can be read [here](http://barry-grubb.com/).

## Skills

#### Programming

I've long been drawn toward programming and have used it at an intermediate level throughout several interests, including independent game development and some light web development. In 2016 I decided to apply for Makers Academy in order to properly learn to program, and I believe that it was one of the best decisions I've ever made. I now have a thorough understanding of the following:

- Test Driven Development
- Domain Driven Design
- Object Oriented Programming
- Software Craftsmanship
- Extreme Programming

#### Interface Design

Prior to Makers Academy I worked for six years as an interface designer in the engineering industry, which has provided me with a fantastic amount of experience regarding UI, UX and usability. I worked closely with  a team of developers, of which I was the sole designer. This experience will no doubt prove invaluable in my future software development career.

- Photoshop
- Illustrator
- Usability
- Designing visual interfaces which do not rely on the user's ability to read any particular language.
- Working within very tight technical constraints to produce a useable interface.

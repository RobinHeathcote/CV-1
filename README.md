I'm a graduate of [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/employers/), Europe's leading software development bootcamp, where I learned to code following a whole host of best practices and Agile Methodologies. I love OOP/OOD, TDD/BDD, the SOLID principles, and keeping my code DRY.

Right now I'm looking for my first employment opportunity since graduating, preferably somewhere that I'll be pushed to my limits to learn new skills in order to be the best that I can be.

## Skills

#### Programming

For most of my life I've at least dabbled in programming, and have used it at an intermediate level for various interests including independent game development and some light web development. Toward the end of 2015 I decided to apply for Makers Academy in order to *properly* learn how to program, and after a series of interviews and tech tests I found myself to be within the top 10% of applicants who actually earn a place there. Completing the course was incredibly tough, but I believe it was one of the best decisions I've ever made. I now have a strong understanding of, and importantly a passion for:

- Test Driven Development / Behavior Driven Development.
- Object Oriented Programming / Object Oriented Design.
- Domain Driven Design.
- Agile Methodologies.
- Software Craftsmanship.
- Extreme Programming.

#### Interface Design

Before attending Makers Academy I worked for six years as an interface designer within the engineering industry, which provided me with a fantastic amount of experience working with and understanding the requirements of effective UI, UX and usability. During this time I worked closely with a team of developers, of which I was the sole designer. There were many fantastic learning experiences:

- UI, UX, Usability.
- Design and creation of hundreds of graphical assets including icons, buttons, toggles, tabs, progress bars, spinners, and much more.
- Designing visual interfaces that don't rely on the user's ability to read any particular written language.
- Working within very tight technical constraints to produce a useable, intuitive interface.
- Adobe Photoshop.
- Adobe Illustrator.

#### Technical Illustration

Before attending Makers Academy I worked for a little under six years as a technical illustrator within the engineering industry. I'm able to produce several styles of technical illustration including line work, shaded, 2D or 3D. I'm experienced at producing illustrations from either photographic or computer generated references. I've used the following to produce my illustrations:

- Adobe Creative Suite.
- Google/Trimble SketchUp.
- Third-party SketchUp rendering engines.
- Dassault Systemes 3DVIA.

#### Technical Documentation

During my time working within the engineering industry I spent four and a half years as a technical author. During this time I authored and compiled dozens of instruction manuals for engineering equipment. This role required me to be able to produce written instruction to a very high standard, and to regularly liaise with the mechanical and electrical engineering teams to ensure that the documentation was produced accurately. This role also required that I build HTML/CSS interfaces which the clients could use to access the documentation. Further to this I regularly also dealt with external translation companies in order to produce documentation in the client's own language. I used the following when working as a technical author:

- Adobe FrameMaker.
- Microsoft Office.
- HTML/CSS.
